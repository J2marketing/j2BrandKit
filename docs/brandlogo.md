## Logo Update

<img class="downloadable" src="../img/LogoUpdate.png">

The new DTSB logo is not a drastic change, but carries a strong, powerful new mark. It is sleek and modern, showing a commitment to match the constant evolution of South Bend.
Furthermore, this new logo has no floating pieces. The logo can be built as a physical installation and easily stand on its own without having the space in the D or B need to be magically filled.

## Co-Branding

Co-Branding is an essential part of a sizeable non-profit. For all collaborations with other brands, follow the guides below. Lockups must be created by DTSB and sent to external corporations for their use. Be very intentional about this â€“ do not let other businesses create their own lockups, for they will not have the same respect for your brand as you.
