## Logo Update

<img class="downloadable" src="../img/LogoUpdate.png">

The new DTSB logo is not a drastic change, but carries a strong, powerful new mark. It is sleek and modern, showing a commitment to match the constant evolution of South Bend.
Furthermore, this new logo has no floating pieces. The logo can be built as a physical installation and easily stand on its own without having the space in the D or B need to be magically filled.
