## Brandjectives Overview

So what are brandjectives™?

At J2, Brandjectives™ are how we communicate the over-arching themes of a brand. Brandjectives are both adjectives that describe your business, and objectives for your marketing. Aim to fulfill every brandjective with every piece of marketing material that you create.

## Clear

DTSB needs to, above all else, communicate clearly. It doesn’t matter if all of our graphics/words are fun, engaging, exciting, and interesting, if they don’t have any helpful information.

## Local

The most obvious, and yet the most important goal is to be local. Everything we do should focus on South Bend.

## Accessible

Everything you do needs to communicate an ease of use. Your events have attractions for the whole family.  That needs to come across in all of your communication.

## Inclusive

INCLUSIVE – South Bend is a diverse city. We need to showcase that diversity in our marketing materials.
